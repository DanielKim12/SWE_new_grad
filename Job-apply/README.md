# Job Application Tracker

## Overview

This **Job Application Tracker** is a personal project designed to help me stay organized and accountable during my job search process. By using a Jupyter Notebook, I can track all the positions I've applied for, keep my resume updated, and record important details about each application, such as application status, interview preparation, and any additional tasks needed to follow up.

The main goal of this tracker is to keep a structured log of job applications and ensure that I don't miss important steps in the hiring process. It also helps with organizing all the applied positions in a single CSV file for easy reference and analysis.

## Features

- **Add Job Applications**: Easily add details about each job application, including company name, job title, application date, current status, and any additional notes (e.g., application deadlines, contacts).
- **Update Application Status**: Modify the status of an existing application (e.g., Applied, Interviewed, Rejected, Offer).
- **Track Interview Preparation**: Document any interview prep work and other actions required to improve chances for success (e.g., coding practice, research about the company).
- **Visualize Job Status**: See a bar chart representing the number of job applications in different statuses (e.g., how many are in the "Applied" state versus "Interviewed" or "Rejected").
- **Export to CSV**: Save all job application data in a CSV file for easy access and future reference.
- **Resume Updates**: Keep a log of when and how you updated your resume for specific job applications.
- **Stay Accountable**: With a clear log of your job search progress, you can keep yourself on track to ensure you're applying to jobs consistently and preparing properly for interviews.
